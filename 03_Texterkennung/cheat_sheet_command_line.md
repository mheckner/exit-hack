# Cheatsheet Command Line
Typically today, users interact with a computer through a graphical user interface and navigate through folders by pointing and clicking with a cursor. In programming however, this is often done through typing commands, instead of clicking. This page explains some typical commands that you might need in order to solve the exit coding game.

Those commands are typed in the shell. The following image shows the state of the shell after the user has typed in the command `pwd`, followed by hitting the enter button. In this case the result of this command (`/home/runner/exit-coding-game`) is shown in the next line.

### Showing the path to the current folder
Type pwd to show the path to the current folder (the user is in the folder /home/runner/exit-coding-game):
```console
~/exit-coding-game$ pwd
/home/runner/exit-coding-game
```
Note that the user is currently in the folder /exit-coding-game and pwd is the command that the user types (followed by enter). 
/home/runner/exit-coding-game is the output (i.e. the answer) of the command pwd.

### Showing all files in the current folder

### Changing into a directory one level down (i.e. clicking into a folder)

### Changing into a directory one level up (i.e. clicking into the parent folder of the current folder)

### Showing all files in the folder

### Running the code in a Python script

To run (or execute) the code in the Python file hello_world.py, type the following command:
```shell
python3 hello_world.py
