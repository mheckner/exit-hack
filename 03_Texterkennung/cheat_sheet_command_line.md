# Cheatsheet Command Line
Typically today, users interact with a computer through a graphical user interface and navigate through folders by pointing and clicking with a cursor. In programming however, this is often done through typing commands, instead of clicking. This document explains some typical commands that you need to solve the exit coding game.

Those commands 

### Showing the current path to the current folder
```console
foo@bar:~$ whoami
foo

```shell
python3 hello_world.py
```

### Showing all files in the current folder

### Changing into a directory one level down (i.e. clicking into a folder)

### Changing into a directory one level up (i.e. clicking into the parent folder of the current folder)

### Showing all files in the folder
