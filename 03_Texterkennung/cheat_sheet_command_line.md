# Cheatsheet Command Line
Typically today, users interact with a computer through a graphical user interface and navigate through folders by pointing and clicking with a cursor. In programming however, this is often done through typing commands, instead of clicking. This document explains some typical commands that you need to solve the exit coding game.

Those commands 

### Showing the path to the current folder
Type pwd to show the path to the current folder (the user is in the folder /home/runner/exit-coding-game):
```console
~/exit-coding-game$ pwd
/home/runner/exit-coding-game
```
Note that the user is currently in the folder /exit-coding-game and pwd is the command that the user types (followed by enter). 
/home/runner/exit-coding-game is the output (i.e. the answer) of the command pwd.

### Showing all files in the current folder

### Changing into a directory one level down (i.e. clicking into a folder)

### Changing into a directory one level up (i.e. clicking into the parent folder of the current folder)

### Showing all files in the folder

### Running the code in a Python script

To run (or execute) the code in the Python file hello_world.py, type the following command:
```shell
python3 hello_world.py
```
