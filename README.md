This is repository for an Exit Coding Game. It contains all information that is required by the participants to solve the puzzles of the game.

# How to navigate
Each of the top-level folders maps to one puzzle of the game. All the relevant clues for the puzzle are included in these folders. Participants that are working on the first puzzle can thus ignore all other folders. Each folder contains the following material:

* A slides folder with an introductory slidedeck
* An examples folder that contains example code from the introductory slidedeck
* A cheatsheet that provides additional hints and examples
* Potential additional material
